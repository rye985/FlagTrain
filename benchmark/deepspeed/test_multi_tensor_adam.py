"""Performance benchmark for the multi_tensor_adam operator.

The baseline follows ``_DEEPSPEED_BASELINE_VENDORS`` below:

* on a listed backend, DeepSpeed's ``multi_tensor_adam`` **is** the baseline. If
  it cannot be built there the module raises rather than falling back -- timing
  the torch reference and reporting it under the same name would answer a
  different question;
* on any other backend the baseline is ``multi_tensor_adam_ref``, the
  plain-torch composition of the same contract.

Unlike LAMB, each benchmark case runs the optimizer over a *batch* of parameter
tensors rather than a single one. That is the whole point of the operator: the
per-tensor launch cost is amortized across the batch, so the relevant axis is
``(n_tensors, numel_per_tensor)`` and not just ``numel``.

Only fp32 and fp16 are benchmarked. DeepSpeed's CUDA op dispatches only
fp16/fp32/fp64 via ``DISPATCH_DOUBLE_FLOAT_AND_HALF`` and has no bf16 kernel, so
a bf16 case would compare the Triton op against a different arithmetic path
rather than an apples-to-apples baseline. The Triton op *does* support bf16 --
that is covered by the correctness tests, not here.
